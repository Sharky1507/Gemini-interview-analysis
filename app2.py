            You are inside a streamlit app, add spaces, highlight subheaders where ever necessary.
            Analyze the given video and provide the following information, highlight wherever necessary:
            1. Is the speech too long or too short?
            2. How confident does the speaker appear?
            3. What is the overall tone and clarity of the speech?
            4. Extract information about the candidate like, skills, experience, etc.
            5. What is the overall emotion of the candidate?
            7. Give a score out of 10 for the candidate.
            8. No need to give recommendations
            here is an example of a response:
            'This is a very short interview, barely lasting 50 seconds. It feels more like a candidate reading out their resume rather than engaging in a conversation.

            Here's a breakdown:

            Speech Length: Too short. It doesn't provide enough information to form a well-rounded impression.
            Confidence: The speaker appears moderately confident. He speaks clearly, but there's a lack of passion or excitement in his voice. He seems a bit nervous.
            Tone and Clarity: The tone is neutral and factual. The speech is clear and easy to understand, although there are a couple of instances of hesitation (e.g., "uh" before "Kota") which suggests a lack of preparation or potential nervousness.
            Skills and Experience:
            Education: Appex University, Jaipur (no specific degree mentioned)
            Certifications: VCA (no context provided)
            Courses: Android Developer (from Placements Adda - no further detail)
            Work Experience: ThinkDeva (XML work, APPS, Camera-based work - no specific job title mentioned)
            Seeking: Android Developer Intern (May to August)
            Overall Emotion: Neutral. There's a lack of positive or enthusiastic energy.
            Score out of 10: 5/10. The candidate provides basic information but lacks depth and engagement.'
